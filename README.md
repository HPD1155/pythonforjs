# pythonforjs
This is a basic library with python function. We are making this open source so people can contribute to adding mechanisms.
We are starting off with basic functions such as ```print() ``` and others. Add to this so we can grow it.

# info
- Use this in html websites, if you want to add it for front end(or back-end) webdevelopment. 
- This could be used in replit.com due to it having html, css, and js.
